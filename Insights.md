# Finding and Insights

Through comprehensive analyses, the initial goal was to uncover actionable insights to help travelers save on flight costs. However, as the data exploration progressed, it became evident that the findings could also benefit airlines significantly. These insights provided opportunities to refine pricing strategies, enhance operations, and improve customer satisfaction. This dual advantage demonstrated the potential of data analytics to drive smarter decision-making for both customers and airlines, creating a mutually beneficial impact across the aviation industry.   

## Customer Perspective

For starters, the analyses offered multiple practical takeaways for travelers seeking to optimize their travel budgets. Descriptive analytics highlighted the cost-saving potential of late-night flights. A histogram comparing departure times with ticket prices revealed that flights departing between 10 PM and 4 AM consistently had ticket prices 15–20% lower than flights during peak times, such as mornings and evenings. This finding provides a clear strategy for budget-conscious travelers, especially those with flexible schedules or non-urgent travel needs, to save money by choosing less popular times to fly.      

Similarly, the boxplot analysis comparing ticket prices across flight stops emphasized that flights with multiple stops are significantly cheaper than non-stop options. For instance, flights with two stops had a median price approximately 30% lower than direct flights. Although these options involve longer travel times and possible inconvenience, they can be ideal for passengers prioritizing savings over convenience. This insight is especially valuable for leisure travelers or those booking at the last minute, as it offers a way to reduce travel expenses.       

Diagnostic and predictive analytics provided further clarity on how travel class affects ticket pricing. A scatterplot of travel class versus ticket price highlighted that Business class tickets were, on average, 2.5 times more expensive than Economy class for the same route. For example, a Delhi to Mumbai flight costing ₹8,000 in Economy could cost ₹20,000 in Business class. These empower customers to make informed decisions by weighing the premium services offered in Business class against their budget constraints. Additionally, the Random Forest predictive model identified departure time as a critical factor influencing price, further reinforcing that booking flights during off-peak hours can lead to significant savings. By avoiding peak travel hours such as early mornings and evenings, travelers can optimize their travel budgets while maintaining convenience.     

## Airline Perspective

On the other hand, the findings offered airlines valuable insights to enhance profitability and efficiency while addressing customer needs. The diagnostic analysis revealed that travel class was the strongest predictor of ticket prices, followed by departure time and the number of stops. A bar chart of departure time versus ticket prices demonstrated that non-stop flights during early morning hours commanded some of the highest average prices. Airlines can leverage this demand by introducing additional premium services, such as faster check-ins or exclusive lounges, to further monetize these high-demand time slots.      

Predictive analytics reinforced these observations, providing accurate forecasting models like the Random Forest model, which achieved an R-squared value of 0.975. This high level of accuracy enables airlines to dynamically adjust prices based on demand patterns. For instance, flights on busy routes such as Delhi to Bangalore can be priced strategically higher on weekends, when both business and leisure travelers overlap. Additionally, the feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model revealed opportunities to refine marketing strategies. For example, airlines could promote Economy class seats during off-peak hours to attract budget travelers while upselling Business class seats during peak times to maximize revenue.           

The prescriptive analysis expanded on these findings by offering operational recommendations. A decision tree model suggested introducing direct flights on high-demand routes like Delhi to Bangalore, where indirect flights dominate the market. Adding such direct flights could capture untapped demand and provide a significant competitive edge. Further, Monte Carlo simulations tested various pricing scenarios and revealed that a 10% increase in ticket prices on premium routes could generate over ₹25 million in additional annual revenue without significantly affecting demand. This demonstrates the potential for airlines to fine-tune pricing strategies and enhance profitability while maintaining a strong market position.      

## Conclusion

The insights bridge the interests of both customers and airlines, showing how analytics can deliver value to all stakeholders. Travelers benefit from transparent and actionable advice, such as choosing late-night flights, considering Economy class, or opting for multiple-stop flights to reduce costs. At the same time, airlines gain tools to optimize pricing, tailor services, and explore new growth opportunities.     

For example, the recommendation to introduce direct flights on high-demand routes benefits both parties. Travelers enjoy shorter travel times and greater convenience, while airlines capture additional market share and revenue. Similarly, understanding the price sensitivity of various customer segments allows airlines to implement dynamic pricing strategies that maximize profitability without alienating budget-conscious travelers. Monte Carlo simulations further supported this balance by showing that moderate price increases on premium routes could significantly boost revenue with minimal impact on demand.
